# TriviaGame
This is a basic web based trivia game using a combination of html, bootstrap, and jquery.  The theme for it is Las Vegas hotels thanks to my first ever trip recently to Las Vegas.

# Rules of the Game
Once you click the start button to start the game, you have 15 seconds to answer each question.  After your guess, or after the time has passed, the game will tell you if you're right or wrong.  At the end of the game it'll show you your total score.

# See it in Action
I have posted a working version of the game to [Github Pages](https://chrisducey01.github.io/TriviaGame)

# Ways to contribute
I built this game to show the basics of setTimeout and setInterval in Javascript.  To get it started, I pulled random facts from my trip or the web, and used them to start off with six questions.  Some ways to make the game better:

1. Add more questions
2. Update it so that it pulls from a library of questions instead of being hard-coded into the Javascript
3. Improve the game background versus just being black (the goal was to demo some Javascript functionality versus html/css design)
